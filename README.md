## Introduction

*Booklooker* is a single-page app created using the MERN stack: MongoDB, the Express web application framework, React, and Node.js. The app was initially bootstrapped using Create-React-App.

### Using Booklooker
- On the main page of the app, enter a search term for a book. Booklooker performs a search using the Google Books API and displays the title, author(s), description, cover art, and a link to the book on Google Play.
- To view a book on Google Play, click the üëÅ icon next to the search result.
- To save a book as a favorite, click the bookmark icon next to the search result.
- To view your saved books, click the *Saved* link in the navigation bar. The app will dispaly only the books that have been saved.

**NOTE:** In the interest of a simple demonstration of the app's capability, *Booklooker* does not use any user authentication. So remember: anybody can save books, and anyone can delete them!
